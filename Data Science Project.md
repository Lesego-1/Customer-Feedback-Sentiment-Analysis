### Project: **Customer Feedback Sentiment Analysis with Product Improvement Suggestions**

**Problem Overview:**
Your company receives large amounts of customer feedback daily across various channels (emails, social media, surveys, product reviews, etc.). While some of this feedback is structured (e.g., ratings), most of it is unstructured (text data). Your task is to analyze this feedback and automatically classify the sentiment of each feedback message, while also extracting key insights to suggest potential product improvements based on frequent customer complaints or requests.

The project should leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP), machine learning, and deep learning models to build a system capable of providing valuable insights to the product team.

### **Project Goals:**

1. **Sentiment Classification:**
   - Build a model to classify feedback into predefined sentiment categories: Positive, Negative, Neutral.
   - Leverage NLP techniques such as tokenization, text cleaning, and embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe, or BERT).
   - Experiment with different models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, LSTM, BERT) to find the best performing classifier.

2. **Feedback Theme Extraction (Topic Modeling):**
   - Use topic modeling (e.g., LDA or BERTopic) to identify key themes and patterns in the feedback data.
   - Discover recurring complaints or feature requests to help prioritize product improvements.

3. **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis:**
   - Perform aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) to determine which specific product features (e.g., usability, performance, customer support) are being praised or criticized.
   - Create a multi-label classifier that associates feedback with specific product aspects and assigns a sentiment to each aspect.

4. **Text Summarization:**
   - Implement a text summarization model (e.g., using a sequence-to-sequence transformer like T5 or BART) to condense lengthy customer feedback into short, meaningful summaries for quick review by the product team.

### **Technical Requirements:**

- **Data Source:**
   - Collect real-world datasets such as Amazon product reviews, Yelp reviews, or open feedback datasets from Kaggle.
   - Optionally, you can scrape reviews from different platforms using tools like Scrapy, Selenium, or BeautifulSoup.
   - Pre-process and clean the data (e.g., remove stopwords, lemmatization, etc.).

- **Models to Use:**
   - Sentiment Classification: Experiment with traditional models (SVM, Logistic Regression) and deep learning models (LSTM, BERT).
   - Topic Modeling: LDA, BERTopic, or Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF).
   - Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis: Build a custom multi-label classifier or leverage existing pre-trained models for ABSA.
   - Text Summarization: Utilize a pre-trained transformer model like BART or T5.

- **Evaluation Metrics:**
   - Sentiment Classification: Accuracy, F1-score, Precision, and Recall.
   - Topic Modeling: Coherence Score and Human interpretability of topics.
   - ABSA: Precision, Recall, F1-score for each product aspect.
   - Text Summarization: Rouge score or BLEU score for evaluating summarization.

- **Deliverables:**
   1. A full pipeline from data ingestion to model deployment.
   2. A final notebook or report documenting the model selection process, hyperparameter tuning, and key insights extracted from the data.
   3. Deploy the final sentiment classification and aspect-based analysis models into a REST API using Django or Flask, which allows the product team to input customer feedback and receive real-time results.
   4. Visualize the sentiment analysis, topics, and feedback themes using interactive dashboards with Plotly/Dash or a similar tool.

### **Bonus Challenges:**
- **Real-Time Feedback Monitoring:**
   - Implement a real-time dashboard that continuously pulls customer feedback from live sources (e.g., Twitter API, feedback forms) and updates sentiment analysis and topic extraction dynamically.
   
- **Model Interpretability:**
   - Use techniques like LIME or SHAP to explain why the models make certain predictions, providing transparency to stakeholders.

### **Skills Tested:**
- NLP and Text Processing (Tokenization, Lemmatization, Stopwords)
- Deep Learning (LSTM, Transformer models)
- Model selection and hyperparameter tuning
- REST API development (Django/Flask)
- Data visualization and reporting (Plotly/Dash)
- Experience with cloud deployment (AWS/GCP/Azure) for scalability.
